Collection Picker
=================

A simple user control and implementation in a dialog that lets users pick an item from a collection. For your prototyping needs.

There is room for improvement here. Right now this only provides a little sugar on top of the basic need. I usually use this when throwing together a quick prototype- direct picking from a collection hasn't made it into a production project of mine yet.
